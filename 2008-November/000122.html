<PRE>Hi portpkg developers :)

I'm the lead developer of kongoni, a slackware based distro currently
in development that intends to use portpkg as our default package
manager.
For the most part, very well done on what is possibly the best and
most slack-like slackware package management system I've encountered.
Not to mention that ports came from BSD systems and slackware was
based on BSD systems so it's a natural fit that was way overdue.

I do see two things that present room for improvement though. The
first lies in the version comparison. Currently, portpkg seems to
assume that the version of a package in the repo if different from the
locally installed one, is always newer. This causes problems though -
for example people using Robbie's KDE4 packages with the slackware
binary tree enabled will find portpkg trying to 'upgrade' their KDE4
packages to KDE3 packages.
Fair enough - I've written code in this field and I know that version
comparisons are hard. The Debian guys came up with what is probably
the most reliable algorithm available though and it's fairly simple to
implement.
So my first question is, if I were to write a debian algorithm based
version comparison algorithm for portpkg would you accept the patch
upstream ? The original code for dpkg is written in C but the
algorithm can be implemented in any language. The below description
comes from the dpkg manpage:
--------
First the initial part of each string consisting entirely of non-digit
characters is determined. These two parts (one of which may be empty)
are compared lexically. If a difference is found it is returned. The
lexical comparison is a comparison of ASCII values modified so that
all the letters sort earlier than all the non-letters and so that a
tilde sorts before anything, even the end of a part. For example, the
following parts are in sorted order from earliest to latest: ~~, ~~a,
~, the empty part, a.[36]

Then the initial part of the remainder of each string which consists
entirely of digit characters is determined. The numerical values of
these two parts are compared, and any difference found is returned as
the result of the comparison. For these purposes an empty string
(which can only occur at the end of one or both version strings being
compared) counts as zero.

These two steps (comparing and removing initial non-digit strings and
initial digit strings) are repeated until a difference is found or
both strings are exhausted.
--------

Granted this requires at least SOME sanity in package version numbers
but in my tests on slackware like package it had a very high success
rate (more accurately, I never saw it fail - I just know it could).

If I wanted to implement such a check for portpkg, where in the code
should I start to look ? I haven't fully studied the code for portpkg
yet but I will be doing so in the near future.

The next question is more specific to the task of using portpkg as the
default package manager in the distro - in that scenario, you do not
want the ports tree to be replicated by every single user, you want
downloads of dist files etc. to be shared.
I have a suggestion on how I would like to implement this, which does
not require any changes to portpkg but I would like your thoughts on
it as the core developers.

1) Create a system user called portpkg with a home directory in /usr/portpkg
2) Change the owning user of /usr/bin/portpkg to portpkg and set the
sticky bit on it.
At this stage, portpkg will always run as the user portpkg, and will
work in the /usr/portpkg directory.
This however causes one small problem - updated portpkg packages will
reset permissions on portpkg.
So the next version is:
2)Create a group called portpkg as well, set up sudoers so that
members of this group can run
sudo -u portpkg (with any options)
3) Add the needed configs for the portpkg user to be able to run
upgradepkg with root privileges over sudo.

Now there is a single shared repository, any user who belongs to the
portpkg group can run portpkg (though it needs to be done with sudo
but a wrapper script/frontend can handle that) and nobody needs to
know the root password. By controlling membership of the portpkg
group, the admin can decide which users should have the ability to
install software.
